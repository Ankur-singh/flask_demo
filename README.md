# Flask MeetUp (26th Jan, 2020)
***

The primary aim of the meetup was to get people started with Flask. Also, to give them a very basic idea of how to make a web application and finally discuss the challenges of deploying a machine learning model. 

The repository has all the files that I used in the meetup. A small description of all the files is as follows:
- **1_urls.py** : URLs in flask
- **2_templates.py** : Jinja template engine in flask
- **templates/** : includes all .html files
- **3_prime.py** : program that takes a number and returns whether its prime or not.
- **prime_new.py** : refactored prime number code, to be used with flask.
- **iris.py** : program for training a ML model on iris dataset and saving the model + scaler.
- **iris_new.py** : refactored iris.py code, to be used with flask.
- **final_ml_flask.py** : Final flask application that takes in flower dimensions as input and returns its class.
- **ml_flask.pptx** : presentation that I used (Disclaimer: not very useful).

I will be updating this repo further. Here are some of the things that I am planning to do next:
- Trainning a Machine learning model on a more complex dataset with a lot of preprocessing.
- Static files in flask. Including CSS, JavaScript & images.
- etc.
